# riverpod-learning

Basically learning the ins and outs of Riverpod. There's 5 basic examples, and an instagram clone. Following [this 17-hour tutorial by Vandad Nahavandipoor, highly recommended.](https://youtu.be/vtGCteFYs4M).

I'm gonna add some pictures of it later on, and make this README page a lil bootiful, for absolutely no reason. It doesn't benefit me or anyone at all, but as Aristotle always say, why the fuck not?
